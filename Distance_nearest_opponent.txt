%% Distance to nearest opponent

% This function calculates players' distances to their nearest opponent.

% 1. Arrange the input arrays for Team 1 and Team 2 in alternating columns
% of x- and y-coordinates with each row of timestamp. Make sure the two 
% arrays have same number of rows, and an even number of columns.

% 2. The output is as follows: Nearest_Opp is a time-series array of every
% player's distance to his nearest opponent. Columns of Team 1 players first,
% followed by columns of Team 2 players

% 3. Nearest_Opp_mean is the average value of distance to nearest opponent.
% Column 1 is Team 1's mean distance to nearest opponent. Column 2 is Team
% 2's mean distance to nearest opponent. Column 3 is the mean distance to
% nearest opponent for both teams

function [Nearest_Opp, Nearest_Opp_mean] = Distance_nearest_opponent(Team1, Team2)

% Counts number of players in each team by dividing the number of columns
% in each team array by two
n_Team1 = size(Team1,2)/2;
n_Team2 = size(Team2,2)/2;

% Total number of players
n_Total = n_Team1 + n_Team2;

% Concatenate both team arrays into one large array
Both_teams = [Team1 Team2];

% Form an array that pivots Both_teams. Preallocate for speed.
Both_teams_pivot = NaN(n_Total, size(Both_teams,1)*2);

k = 1;

for i=1:size(Both_teams,1);
    
    % Each unit of time series is now denoted by every second column 
    % (x- and y-coordinates)
    % The 20 rows indicate 20 outfield players; first 10 are Team 1.
    Both_teams_pivot(:, k) = Both_teams(i,1:2:end)';
    Both_teams_pivot(:, k+1) = Both_teams(i,2:2:end)';
    
    k = k + 2;
    
end


% Preallocating an array for every player's distance to his nearest
% opponent.
Nearest_Opp = NaN(size(Both_teams,1),n_Team1+n_Team2);

for i=1:size(Nearest_Opp,1);
    
    % Calculate the distance of every player to every other player
    D = pdist(Both_teams_pivot(:,i*2-1:i*2));
    
    % Presents these pairwise distances in a matrix form
    Z = squareform(D);
    
    % Finds each player's distance to the nearest opponent
    % Team 1
    Nearest_Opp(i, 1:n_Team1) = min(Z(1:n_Team1,n_Team1+1:end), [],2)';
    % Team 2
    Nearest_Opp(i, n_Team1+1:end) = min(Z(n_Team1+1:end,1:n_Team1), [],2)';
    
end

% Average distance to nearest opponent:
% Col 1: average distance to nearest opponent for Team 1
Nearest_Opp_mean(:,1) = mean(Nearest_Opp(:,1:n_Team1),2);

% Col 2: average distance to nearest opponent for Team 2
Nearest_Opp_mean(:,2) = mean(Nearest_Opp(:,n_Team1+1:end),2);

% Col 3: average distance to nearest opponent for both teams
Nearest_Opp_mean(:,3) = mean(Nearest_Opp,2);
