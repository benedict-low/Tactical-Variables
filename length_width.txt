%% Team length and width

% Team length: distance between the most advanced and least advanced player
% Team width: distance between the two widest players on the pitch

% 1. Input must be arranged in alternating x- and y- columns for each unit 
% of time series.

% 2. Output is a two-column array in time series.
% Column 1: Team length
% Column 2: Team width
