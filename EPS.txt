%% Effective playing space

% Polygonal area of all players on the periphery of play, calculated using
% a convex hull method

% 1. Input must be arranged in alternating x- and y- columns for each unit 
% of time series.

% 2. Output is a single-column array in time series.

function SurfaceArea = EPS(Team)

% Preallocate a time-series array for EPS
SurfaceArea = NaN(size(Team,1), 1);

for i = 1:size(SurfaceArea,1);
    
    [~, SurfaceArea(i,1)] = convhull(Team(i,1:2:end), Team(i,2:2:end));
    
end
