%% Stretch index

% Mean distance of every teammate to their team centroid

% 1. Input must be arranged in alternating x- and y- columns for each unit 
% of time series. 

% 2. Output is a single-column array in time series

function StretchIndex = stretch_index(Team)

% First calculate the team centroid
Centroid_Team = [mean(Team(:,1:2:end),2) mean(Team(:,2:2:end),2)];

% Count the number of players in Team
n_Team = size(Team,2)/2;
        
% For simplicity, use repmat such that the size of the
% Centroid_Team array is the same as Team
Centroid_Team_repeated = repmat(Centroid_Team, 1, n_Team);

% Calculate every player's distance to the team centroid
D = Team-Centroid_Team_repeated;
Dist_to_centroid_Team = hypot(D(:,1:2:end), D(:,2:2:end));

% Compute the stretch index
StretchIndex = mean(Dist_to_centroid_Team, 2);
