%% Length per width (LpW) ratio

% Team length divided by team width. 

% Team length: distance between the most advanced and least advanced player
% Team width: distance between the two widest players on the pitch

% Implications: Larger values, more elongated playing shape; 
% smaller values, more flattened playing shape

% 1. Input must be arranged in alternating x- and y- columns for each unit 
% of time series.

% 2. Output is a single-column array in time series.


function LpW = LpW_ratio(Team)

LengthWidth = [max(Team(:,1:2:end),[],2)-min(Team(:,1:2:end),[],2), ...
    max(Team(:,2:2:end),[],2)-min(Team(:,2:2:end),[],2)];

LpW = LengthWidth(:,1)./LengthWidth(:,2);
